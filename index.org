* What
- Earl Louis Quilling's website
- Aliases: Earl, Louis, Lewis, equillin, selffins

* Academic Profile
- A CS undergraduate student at CMU
- Minoring in Principles of Programming Languages and Professional Writing
- Primary areas of academic interest: proof theory, interactive theorem provers, formal verification
- I am also minoring in Professional Writing - an aim of mine is to study how to communicate my interests - proof theory/metamathematics and formal methods - to wider audiences.

* Work so far

** Formal Verification
- Right now, I am conducting an independent study - learning the Rocq theorem prover and using Rocq to study proof systems—i.e. mechanized metatheory.
- The independent study is a reading of the excellent book Software Foundations. My progress is documented here: https://selffins.github.io/lf/
- I am planning to do a QSIURP extending the independent study with Dr. Giselle Reis. After learning Rocq, I will be investigating context representation libraries when formalizing metatheory.

** Other
- I was a teaching assistant for CMU-Q's Summer College Preview Program. I co-taught advanced programming, calculus, intro to CS, and English.
- I was a curriculum developer for CMU-Q's Alice under Dr. Saquib Razak.
- I was an instructor for the Alice Summer Program in CMU-Q.
- I was a TA for 15-150 (Intro to Functional Programming).
- I will be a TA for 15-312 (Foundations of Programming Languages) next semester.
- I interned at QCRI for a project called "Towards a Threat Report Annotator" under Dr. Ahmed Lekssays and Dr. Husrev Taha Sencar. I scraped cybersecurity blogs and investigated how to extract structured data (MITRE threat intelligence). I won an award (3rd best project).
