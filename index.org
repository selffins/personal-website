- louis likes [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pretentious][philosophy]], linguistics, psychology, emacs, personal knowledge systems, their cat, and listening to music
- i don't like bold statements, but if i had one, this is My Core Mission: to strive for a slower, peaceful, quieter, kinder, more empathic, more reflective world - internal and external
- idealist in principle, reluctant pragmatist in practice
- i am 40% on the way to becoming a luddite. i am less and less enthusiastic to call myself a computer scientist. i am concerned and skeptic of the state of tech in society right now.
- i cannot respect nor be friends with those who do not like pineapple on pizza / hawaiian pizza (depending on how they reason about why they do not like it)

- motivation and discipline is a myth
- i read this [[https://aeon.co/essays/i-am-a-better-therapist-since-i-let-go-of-therapeutic-theory][essay]] on psychotherapy quite frequently, i am not sure if i fully agree with it, but i think of it often
- [[https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/29/nx-s1-5210688/lonelieness-epidemic-social-isolation-parenting-cohousing][cohousing]] is an interesting proposition
